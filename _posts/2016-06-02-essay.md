I was looking for a tool that can build websites that are fast, simple and secure. These websites needed to be static because I didn’t want to deal with databases or a content management system (CMS) like WordPress or Ghost. After a lot of thought I decided to use Jekyll.

## So what is Jekyll?
Jekyll is a tool for transforming your plain text into static websites and blogs. It is simple, static, and blog-aware. Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language and has builtin Markdown and Textile support. It also ties in nicely to Github Pages so you have the option to host your website for free. You can learn more about Jekyll on their website.

## Preparing to install the GitHub Pages Gem
Installing Jekyll is easy and straight-forward, but there are a few requirements you’ll need to make sure your system has before you start.
