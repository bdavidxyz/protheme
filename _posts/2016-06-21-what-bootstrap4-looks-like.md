description: "A giant asset to see what all visual Bootstrap 4 elements"
---


Here is a giant collection of all visual elements, extracted from Bootstrap 4 docs.

If you like this short article, share it :

## Short answer

The giant asset is here : http://bdavidxyz.github.io/yourown-bootstrap4/all.html

## Long answer

I’m creating your yourown-bootstrap4, an work-in-progress open-source project that will allow you to create your own bootstrap 4 theme “the right way” : it will give you a fast local workflow, an optimised, fast rendering once in production, and a way to visually check how your whole bootstrap distribution will look like.

You can also think about it as an automatic style guide for your own theme.

The job is not yet done (and Bootstrap 4 is not yet also officially released - alpha version now), but I know the impatients will be happy to see what it looks like.

I know there is already the official Bootstrap 4 docs that show all elements, but

- They are dispatched into multiples pages, if you want to quickly see all the assets it takes too much time,
- Visual elements are blurred by stuffs. Docs are here to show you everything, visual elements yes, but also code, explanations, warnings, etc.

So, again :  http://bdavidxyz.github.io/yourown-bootstrap4/all.html

Don’t expect a bunch of new spectacular visual components. There are a few new things of course, but the huge gap relies in the code structure, the default applied, the vertical rhythm, and the number of things that you can now easily customise. This is the topic for another article I presume.
